# Nikita Ravindra Albela - Data Analysis Portfolio

# About
Hi, I'm Nikita! I’m an Aspiring Data Analyst passionate about turning raw data into actionable insights that drive business decisions. I have a strong foundation in SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, and I’m currently pursuing an MBA in Business Analytics, where I combine analytical thinking with strategic business understanding.

My project experience spans across sales, resource allocation, Healthcare, and Insurance Analytics, focusing on growth optimization, customer segmentation, and performance improvement. I bring one year of hands-on experience through two internships a 6-month Data Analytics internship at Rubixe (AI Solutions Company) and a 3-month internship at Oasis Infobyte, where I received excellent client feedback for my analytical contributions.

This repository showcases my projects, skills, and ongoing learning journey in data analytics. I’m driven by curiosity, enjoy uncovering meaningful patterns in data, and believe in continuous learning. Outside of analytics, I’m an avid reader and enjoy painting and sketching in my free time.

# Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing IABAC Exam, all that I have learnt during my interships and put it into practice or while just having fun with data and code.

# Blinkit-Sales-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project
Description: A dynamic retail analytics dashboard built in Power BI to uncover sales patterns and business drivers across Blinkit’s diverse outlet network. Blinkit operates across multiple outlet types, sizes, and locations, offering hundreds of products. This dashboard highlights key drivers-from outlet performance to consumer preferences so the company can make sharper decisions about stocking, marketing, and expansion. I have also conducted Product Relationship Predictive Analysis for this project to check if "Item Weight", "Item Visibility" and "Rating" and it seems that these variables do not predict sales. Blinkit could work on visibility Optimization to increase revenue by further studying the product puchase data which could help Blinkit in understanding consumer preferences that help increase their sales.

# Healthcare Provider financial and resource allocation
Description: The Healthcare Provider Dashboard is an mutlidimensional view built in Power BI analytics project designed to evaluate financial performance, insurance dependency, departmental efficiency, diagnosis, and patient care trends. It combines multiple datasets to uncover actionable insights that help healthcare administrators improve cost management, service delivery, and overall operational performance.
