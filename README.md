# Nikita Ravindra Albela - Data Analysis Portfolio

# About
Hi, I'm Nikita! I’m an Aspiring Data Analyst passionate about turning raw data into actionable insights that drive business decisions. I have a strong foundation in SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, and I’m currently pursuing an MBA in Business Analytics, where I combine analytical thinking with strategic business understanding.

My project experience spans across sales, resource allocation, Healthcare, and Growth Analytics, focusing on growth optimization, customer segmentation, and performance improvement. I bring one year of hands-on experience through two internships a 6-month Data Analytics internship at Rubixe (AI Solutions Company) and a 2-month internship at Oasis Infobyte, where I received excellent client feedback for my analytical contributions.

This repository showcases my projects, skills, and ongoing learning journey in data analytics. I’m driven by curiosity, enjoy uncovering meaningful patterns in data, and believe in continuous learning. Outside of analytics, I’m an avid reader and enjoy painting and sketching in my free time.

# Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing IABAC Exam, all that I have learnt during my interships and put it into practice or while just having fun with data and code.

# Side Projects

# A comparative Study and Marketing strategies of U.S. Retail Market.
Description: 
This project is a strategic data analysis case study on customer segmentation and targeted marketing for the U.S. mall retail market. Built using Power BI, it explores how shopping malls can adapt to changing consumer behavior in the age of e-commerce using RFM modeling, Pareto analysis, and demographic insights.

This project allowed me to apply my MBA knowledge of market analysis and consumer behavior to real-world data. It studies the drop in mall footfall due to online shopping and provides practical suggestions for retailers to stay competitive in the digital era.

Some key ideas include partnering with e-commerce platforms for local delivery, cross-promotions with food courts and theaters, and multi-layout malls offering shared warehouse spaces to reduce costs for both parties.


# Blinkit-Sales-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project
Description: This project presents a dynamic retail analytics dashboard built in Power BI to analyze sales patterns, outlet performance, and consumer behavior across Blinkit’s wide network of stores. With operations spanning multiple store types, sizes, and locations, Blinkit offers a vast product range making data-driven decision-making essential.

The dashboard identifies key performance drivers such as outlet profitability, product categories, and consumer trends, enabling smarter decisions on inventory management, marketing, and expansion strategies.

Additionally, a Product Relationship Predictive Analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of Item Weight, Item Visibility, and Customer Rating on sales. The findings suggest that these variables do not strongly predict sales, indicating that Blinkit could focus on visibility optimization and consumer preference analysis to improve revenue and strengthen its market positioning.

# Healthcare Provider Financial and Resource Allocation

Description: The Healthcare Provider Dashboard is a multidimensional Power BI analytics project designed to evaluate financial performance, insurance dependency, departmental efficiency, and patient care trends. It integrates multiple datasets to provide a holistic view of healthcare operations, enabling administrators to identify cost-saving opportunities, optimize resource utilization, and enhance service delivery.
