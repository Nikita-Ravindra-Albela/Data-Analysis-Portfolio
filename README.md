# About
Hi, I'm Nikita! I'm an Aspiring Data Analyst with a strong foundation in SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, and a deep interest in transforming raw data into actionable business insights. With an MBA in Business Analytics, I combine analytical thinking with strategic business understanding. My projects span across ecommerce, Healthcare, and Insurance Analytics, focusing on growth optimization, customer segmentation, and performance improvement.

This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

# Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing IABAC Exam, all that I have learnt during my interships and put it into practice or while just having fun with data and code.

# Blinkit-Sales-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project
Description: A dynamic retail analytics dashboard built in Power BI to uncover sales patterns and business drivers across Blinkitâ€™s diverse outlet network. Blinkit operates across multiple outlet types, sizes, and locations, offering hundreds of products. This dashboard highlights key drivers-from outlet performance to consumer preferences so the company can make sharper decisions about stocking, marketing, and expansion. I have also conducted Product Relationship Predictive Analysis for this project to check if "Item Weight", "Item Visibility" and "Rating" and it seems that these variables do not predict sales. Blinkit could work on visibility Optimization to increase revenue by further studying the product puchase data which could help Blinkit in understanding consumer preferences that help increase their sales.

# Healthcare Provider financial and resource allocation
Description: The Healthcare Provider Dashboard is an mutlidimensional view built in Power BI analytics project designed to evaluate financial performance, insurance dependency, departmental efficiency, diagnosis, and patient care trends. It combines multiple datasets to uncover actionable insights that help healthcare administrators improve cost management, service delivery, and overall operational performance. 

Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.



Certificates
I believe that the best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result:) So here is a list of the ones I have (in reverse-chronological order, with the date of completion in brackets):
